Hi my name is Kontopodis Emmanouil!

I'm a hobbyist. I learned programming at a technical Highschool when i was young.
I learned Java,C,C++ and Javascript at that time. But my life at that time put me in sales as a waiter cause of a family business and now days i run a business in the retail Industry.
Years passed and somehow Javascript came in my life as a hobby.
And stays as wonderfull hobby!!!
