Hi my name is Kontopodis Emmanouil!

I'm a hobbyist. I learned programming at a technical Highschool when i was young.
I learned Java,C,C++ and Javascript at that time. But my life at that time put me in sales as a waiter cause of a family business.
Years passed and somehow Javascript came in my life as a hobby.

Reactjs and Nextjs are the frameworks I prefer. I've build also an App in Google Play Store called Ultra Lists with React-Native & Expo
