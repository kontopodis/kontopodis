Hi my name is Kontopodis Emmanouil!

I'm a hobbyist. I learned programming at a technical Highschool when i was young.
I learned Java,C,C++ and Javascript at that time. But my life at that time put me in sales asa waiter cause of a family business.
Years passed and somehow Javascript came in my life as a hobby.
Reactjs and Nextjs are the frameworks I prefer. I've build also an App in Google Store called Ultra Lists You may it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kontopodis.UltraLists)
